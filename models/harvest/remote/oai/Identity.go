// Identify is a verb used to retrieve information about a repository.
//
// Some of the information returned is required as part of the OAI-PMH. Repositories may also employ the Identify verb to return additional descriptive information.
// The response must include one instance of the following elements:
// - repositoryName : a human readable name for the repository;
// - baseURL : the base URL of the repository;
// - protocolVersion : the version of the OAI-PMH supported by the repository;
// - earliestDatestamp : a UTCdatetime that is the guaranteed lower limit of all datestamps recording changes, modifications, or deletions in the repository. A repository must not use datestamps lower than the one specified by the content of the earliestDatestamp element. earliestDatestamp must be expressed at the finest granularity supported by the repository.
// - deletedRecord : the manner in which the repository supports the notion of deleted records. Legitimate values are no ; transient ; persistent with meanings defined in the section on deletion.
// - granularity: the finest harvesting granularity supported by the repository. The legitimate values are YYYY-MM-DD and YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ with meanings as defined in ISO8601.
//
// The response must include one or more instances of the following element:
// - adminEmail : the e-mail address of an administrator of the repository.
//
// The response may include multiple instances of the following optional elements:
//
// - compression : a compression encoding supported by the repository. The recommended values are those defined for the Content-Encoding header in Section 14.11 of RFC 2616 describing HTTP 1.1. A compression element should not be included for the identity encoding, which is implied.
// - description : an extensible mechanism for communities to describe their repositories. For example, the description container could be used to include collection-level metadata in the response to the Identify request. Implementation Guidelines are available to give directions with this respect. Each description container must be accompanied by the URL of an XML schema describing the structure of the description container.
