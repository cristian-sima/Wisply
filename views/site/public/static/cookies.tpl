            How do we use cookies?
          </h1>
          We use cookies to improve the "Site" performance and to enhance your user experience. This policy explains how we do that.

            </h2>
            Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.
            <br />
            There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your account and preferences, analyse how well Wisply is performing, or even allow us to recommend resources we believe will be most relevant to you.
            <br />
            Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies <strong>will not</strong> collect information that identifies you, but will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use Wisply.

            In order to deliver its services, Wisply uses these cookies:
            <ol>
              <li>
                session
                <ul>
                  <li>This cookies allows us to have the current connection. It contains an encrypted random number that represents the current connection of the account</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                connection
                <ul>
                  <li>In case the user has opted to remember the connection, Wisply stores a unique token and the account id in a cookie called "connection". When the user tries to access the website, Wisply validates the combination and creates a new session for the account. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                cookieconsent_dismissed
                <ul>
                  <li>According to an EU Directive that was adopted by all EU countries in May 2011, a website must inform its users that it is using cookies which may affect privacy. Thus, the value of "cookieconsent_dismissed" cookie indicates the user has dismissed the information message.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
