// GetRecord is used to retrieve an individual metadata record from a repository.
//
// Required arguments specify the identifier of the item from which the record is requested and the format of the metadata that should be included in the record. Depending on the level at which a repository tracks deletions, a header with a "deleted" value for the status attribute may be returned, in case the metadata format specified by the metadataPrefix is no longer available from the repository or from the specified item.

// ListRecords is a verb used to harvest records from a repository.
//
// Optional arguments permit selective harvesting of records based on set membership and/or datestamp. Depending on the repository's support for deletions, a returned header may have a status attribute of "deleted" if a record matching the arguments specified in the request has been deleted. No metadata will be present for records with deleted status.

// Record is metadata expressed in a single format.
//
// A record is returned in an XML-encoded byte stream in response to an OAI-PMH request for metadata from an item.
// A record is identified unambiguously by the combination of the unique identifier of the item from which the record is available, the metadataPrefix identifying the metadata format of the record, and the datestamp of the record.
// The XML-encoding of records is organized into the following parts: header, metadata, about
