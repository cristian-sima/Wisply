          Wisply tries to change the way the Web science resources are mapped.
          <article>
            <h2>Which is the problem?</h2>
            There are many institutions offering Web science courses in different forms and formats across the world. Initially, it is possible to categorise the nature of these offers, by manually investigating and recording the data. However, this is not a sustainable approach for the long term, because the process is increasingly complex. Not only this method is very costly, but, it is also inefficient, since the Web science is constantly changing. As a result of this, the outcome of the process is outdated compared to what is actually taught. In addition to this problem, there is no software on the market which can provide a map of the Web science in terms of resources and its fields of study.

                Wisply will identify resources from a range of different sources used in the teaching of Web science. It will aggregate and present the resources in a searchable form, mapping them to the Web science curriculum. This collection of aggregated data will be also available for analytical purposes.

              <li>
                The general idea behind this project is to create a tool which can make the process of analysing resources about Web science, in terms of open data, more automated for the long term, with very little interaction from people.

            <h2>Great, why should I use it?</h2>
            Well, firstly, it saves you time and money. An automated tool can use open data to offer a more up-to-date and realistic perspective at a lower cost. b) There can be built analytical tools using the aggregated data in order to generate further results about Web science. c) Mapping resources from a range of different sources may provide a better insight about what actually Web science is, which might be useful for academics. d) In the same way, casual learners have a clearer map of the materials and they can navigate to find the necessary resources (either for teaching or learning). e) The underlining principles of this project might be generalized for other curriculum areas.
